<div class="padding-10">
The Squffy Terms of Service are binding to all users. By joining this site, you agree to all terms and conditions. If you cannot agree, do not sign up. These terms may change at any time, so it is your job to review them regularly and make sure you are familiar with them. Ignorance will not exempt you.<br><br>



* Anything squffy related belongs to the owners of the site.  Except when given permission by the owners, or when allowed by the features of this site, you may not in any way claim as your own anything relating to Squffies.  This includes but is not limited to copying our work (even if you alter or edit it), or selling it for any form of currency, such as real life or virtual.

<br><br>

* The Admins cannot control everything that is said on this site, and cannot guarantee that everything is appropriate for children. For that reason, children under 13 must have their parents' permission before joining.

<br><br>

* If you wish to trade your squffy currency for currency from other websites, you may do so as long as their rules also permit this. The Squffy staff is not responsible if you are duped and lose money and/or items due to such intersite trading.

<br><br>

* In the interest of fairness, each person is allowed to have one account. All users found to be controlling more than one account will have all accounts immediately frozen and may be banned from reregistering.  On these lines, if you have an account on Squffies, you may not buy another account.  You already have one.  If you are on a different site and wish to buy your first squffy account, go right ahead.

<br><br>

* Creating fan art of squffies and using it in other places as avatars (and the like) is allowed, as long as you do not claim the idea as your own. Direct images of squffies may also be used, but you may not pass them off as yours or sell them for any kind of profit. If you are using them on a public site, please provide a link back to this website for credit.

<br><br>

* NEVER provide anybody else with your full name, address, photograph, phone nuber, social security number, or any other personal information. Staff will edit any posts found to contain such information. We are not responsible for any consequences if you do decide to give anybody else personal information.

<br><br>

* You are the ONLY person who needs to know your password and login name. Do NOT under ANY circumstances give this information to anyone else! Staff have no reason to ask for your login name or password. Anyone who says otherwise should be reported to an admin or mod immediately. Anybody found soliciting logins and/or passwords will be banned immediately.

<br><br>

* This site is rated G. The following material is prohibited under all circumstances and will warrant an immediate ban:<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. Pornography<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. Online dating or mature roleplaying (cybering, etc)<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. Threatening or stalking (an)other player(s).

<br><br>

* The following do not necessarily, but sometimes will, warrant an immediate ban. They are highly discouraged and those who commit them will be punished.  Repeat offenders will be banned.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. Spamming the boards or other players.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. Swearing<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. Discussion of religion and/or politics. Such discussions tend to get out of hand. <b>Exception</b>: These may be discussed on the debate board, so long as you respect others' opinions, the PG-13 rating, and laws of general courtesy.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. Harassing or flaming (an)other player(s).

<br><br>

* Admins and Moderators are there for a reason- to moderate.  If you feel there is a problem or a violation of our Terms, please report it to a mod rather than attempting to 'mini-mod' (making forum posts, sending messages to users, etc).  That's what the mods are here for.

<br><br>

* All references to users should be appropriate and respectful, and this includes administrators and moderators.  We are aware there are bugs on the site and we are working on fixing them as quickly as we can. Insulting us will not get something fixed faster.  If there is an issue you would like to bring to our attention, or you would like to speak with us regarding the site, we appreciate and encourage you to contact us provided you are polite.

<br><br>

* Any money sent to Squffies in any form belongs to us.  By sending us your money you are agreeing to this and recognizing that if you send Squiffies money that is not yours, or money that cannot be used for such purposes, Squffies may be unable to return the money and your account and/or anything it contains may be banned or confiscated.

<br><br>

* We do not tolerate theft.  If you have stolen the property (real, virtual or intellectual) of another user, whether or not it was on Squffies, actions will be taken, including but not limited to freezing your account and seizing your items, squffies, and squffy dollars.

*Bugs are bugs, not features.  Using bugs to gain additional items, currency, squffies, or to profit in any way will result in a ban.

<br><br>

* You may not beg or harass other users for things. They have earned those items, squffies, etc. Work at it, and earn your own.

<br><br>

* When using others' services, you are expected to abide by their rules. If you believe someone has violated rules that you set for your services, the matter will be settled by the moderation team.

<br><br>

* We do not take kindly to people who search for loopholes to get around being banned. Do not count on them as a resource.
